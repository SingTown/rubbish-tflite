# Dataset Capture Script - By: wangkaizhi - 周六 10月 24 2020

# Use this script to control how your OpenMV Cam captures images for your dataset.
# You should apply the same image pre-processing steps you expect to run on images
# that you will feed to your model during run-time.

import sensor, image, time

sensor.reset()
sensor.set_pixformat(sensor.RGB565) # Modify as you like.
sensor.set_framesize(sensor.QVGA) # Modify as you like.
sensor.skip_frames(time = 2000)

clock = time.clock()

while(True):
    clock.tick()
    img = sensor.snapshot()
    # Apply lens correction if you need it.
    # img.lens_corr()
    # Apply rotation correction if you need it.
    # img.rotation_corr()
    # Apply other filters...
    # E.g. mean/median/mode/midpoint/etc.
    print(clock.fps())
